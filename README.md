# Cell_PCR_Reader

This is a project to develop automatic processing of output files from experiments in biological laboratory.
The test phase of this project will include Powershell Script - as most biological settings use Windows-operated computers.
The script will detect any new files that had been read by your machine to a specific folder, and pass through different graphical and statistical tests to provide a summary of your experiment that just ran!
